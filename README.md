# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

## Projects:
- [Car Insurance](https://github.com/SuzanneTimm/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)

### Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin 
page that allows staff to view all of th quotes that have been issued.
